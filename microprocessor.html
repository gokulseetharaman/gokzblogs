            <p>The microprocessor, also called the Central Processing Unit (CPU), powers computers and other electronic
                devices. Microprocessors are the "hearts" of data centres, supercomputers, communications products, and
                other digital devices.
                <br> It is a programmable device that takes in input performs some arithmetic and logical operations
                over it and produces the desired output. <br>
                Microprocessor consists of an ALU, register array, and a control unit. ALU performs arithmetical and
                logical operations on the data received from the memory or an input device.

            <p><b>CISC: </b> <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CISC, or Complex Instruction Set A
                computer is an architecture in which instructions can execute multiple low-level operations such as
                loading from memory, storing into memory, or performing an arithmetic operation, among others. It
                contains several addressing nodes within a single instruction. CISC makes use of only a few
                registers.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Example:</b>Intel 386, Intel 486.</p>
            <p><b>RISC: </b> <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; RISC, or Reduced Instruction Set
                Computer, is a computer architecture in which the instructions are simple and designed to be executed
                quickly. Instructions are completed in a single clock cycle as a result of instruction optimisation and
                pipelining. RISC uses multiple registers to avoid large memory interactions. It has a few addressing
                nodes. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Example:</b>IBM RS6000, MC88100.</p>
            <p><b>EPIC: </b> <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; EPIC, or Explicitly Parallel
                Instruction Computing, allows computers to execute instructions in parallel by using compilers. It
                allows complex instructions to be executed without using higher clock frequencies. EPIC encodes its
                instructions as 128-bit bundles. Each bundle consists of three instructions, each encoded in 41 bits,
                and a 5-bit template field.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Example:</b>IA-64 (Intel
                Architecture-64).</p>

        <h2 id="types">Generation of Processors</h2>
        <div class="content">
            <p><b>First Generation (4-Bit Microprocessors): </b>The Intel Corporation first introduced the
                microprocessor in 1971-1972, calling it the Inte­l 4004. This first microprocessor could perform basic
                arithmetic and logic operations. It also included a control unit that could fetch, decode, and execute
                instructions.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Example:</b>Intel 4004.</p>
            <p><b>Secon Generation (8-Bit Microprocessors): </b>The inte­l corporation first introduced the 8 bit
                microprocessor in 1973 with the­ intel 8008. This was followed by an enhance­d model, the intel 8088.
                <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Example:</b>Intel 8085.</p>
            <p><b>Third Generation (16-Bit Microprocessors): </b>The third generation introduced microprocessors that
                could perform 16-bit operations. This generation, introduced in 1978, was represented by processors such
                as the Intel 8086.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Example:</b> Intel 8086, Intel 80286.</p>
            <p><b>Fourth Generation (32-Bit Microprocessors): </b>Several different companies introduced the 32-bit
                microprocessors, but the most popular one is the Intel 80386. <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Example:</b>Intel Pentium.</p>
            <p><b>Fifth Generation (64-Bit Microprocessors): </b>From 1995 to the present, we have seen the fifth
                generation of microprocessors with 64-bit processors, such as Intel's Pentium Pro, which allows multiple
                CPUs to run simultaneously.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Example:</b>Intel Itanium.</p>
