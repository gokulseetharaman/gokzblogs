            <p>Recent developments show ROS2 is being adopted by a wide range of companies, from startups to
                multinational corporations. The release of long-term support versions, like Humble Hawksbill in 2022,
                has boosted its reliability, encouraging more industry players to switch. This shift is driven by ROS2's
                ability to handle larger fleets of robots and meet industrial safety standards.</p>
            <br>

        <h2 id="AdoptionCompanies">Adoption by Major Companies and Organizations</h2>
        <div class="content">
            <p><b>Widespread Industry Uptake:</b> Hundreds of companies now use ROS for developing robots. A 2022 survey
                listed 348 companies using ROS/ROS 2 for products or services, and this number has grown since. In fact,
                analysts predicted that 55% of all commercial robots shipped in 2024 would include at least one ROS
                package, reflecting ROS’s penetration into commercial robotics. This forecast underscores that ROS (in
                practice, ROS 2 for new systems) is becoming commonplace in robots worldwide.</p>
            <p><b>Big Tech and OEM Support:</b> Leading tech companies and robot manufacturers are actively backing ROS
                2. For example, Microsoft provides official ROS 2 support on Windows, and cloud platforms like Amazon
                Web Services and Google Cloud integrate ROS 2. Alphabet’s Intrinsic (an Alphabet company) even acquired
                Open Robotics (the organization behind ROS) in 2022, signaling confidence in ROS 2’s future. Intrinsic’s
                CEO noted ROS has become “an essential platform for robotics developers worldwide”, including at
                Intrinsic itself. Major robot OEMs are on board too: Mitsubishi Electric released an official ROS 2
                driver for its MELFA industrial robot arms in 2024, enabling seamless integration of their factory
                robots with ROS 2 applications. Other industrial giants (ABB, Fanuc, etc.) are likewise working with ROS
                interfaces through the ROS-Industrial consortium.</p>
            <p><b>Commercial Products on ROS 2:</b> Beyond internal R&D, ROS 2 is powering shipped products. Notably,
                iRobot’s latest Create 3 educational robot runs ROS 2 out-of-the-box, exposing all its functions through
                ROS 2 interfaces. Many mobile robot platforms (e.g. Clearpath’s Husky and TurtleBot 4) now default to
                ROS 2. This direct use in products indicates confidence in ROS 2’s stability and value. Beyond internal

                confidence in ROS 2’s stability and value.</p>
            <p><b> Government and Defense Adoption:</b> Government organizations see ROS 2 as a standard for long-term
                robotics programs. The U.S. Department of Defense, for instance, has mandated migration of its
                ROS-Military (ROS-M) platform from ROS 1 to ROS 2. With ROS 1 reaching end-of-life in 2025, the DoD’s
                robotics leaders assert that “this migration is essential to equip the DoD and the entire ground vehicle
                robotics industry with common robotic capabilities for the next 10 to 20 years”. In other words, ROS 2
                will be the basis of future military ground robots, ensuring a common standard across programs. NASA is
                also embracing ROS 2 – it used ROS 1 on the ISS’s Robonaut and Astrobee and will use ROS 2 in the
                upcoming VIPER lunar rover mission for ground control systems. Such endorsements from defense and space
                agencies reinforce ROS 2’s status as an emerging standard.</p>

        <h2 id="Ros2overRos">Key Advantages of ROS 2 Over ROS 1</h2>
        <div class="content">
            <p>ROS 2 was a ground-up redesign to address the limitations of ROS 1, specifically so that it could meet
                industry and production use-case requirements. Key advantages include:</p>
            <p><b>Real-Time and Reliability:</b> ROS 1’s biggest drawback was lack of real-time support and the central
                “master” node that could be a single point of failure. ROS 2 uses DDS (Data Distribution Service) as its
                communication middleware, enabling real-time messaging, configurable QoS, and distributed architecture
                (no master node). This makes ROS 2 far more robust for mission-critical and high-reliability systems. As
                Apex.AI (which certifies ROS 2 for automobiles) put it, the old arguments against using ROS in
                production – “that it is not real-time and not certified” – have now been eliminated with ROS 2. In ROS
                2, nodes can run with deterministic timing and even on real-time OS’s, making it suitable for industrial
                control and safety-critical tasks.</p>
            <p><b>Multi-Robot and Distributed Systems: </b>ROS 2 was designed to natively support multi-robot systems
                and operation over networks that are lossy or have high latency (e.g. Wi-Fi, WAN). Unlike ROS 1, which
                was mainly for single-robot use on a LAN, ROS 2 can easily coordinate multiple robots and integrate with
                cloud services. This is crucial for modern applications like swarms, fleets of warehouse robots, or
                connected autonomous vehicles.</p>
            <p><b>Security:</b> ROS 2 introduced SROS2, providing security features like authentication and encryption
                for topics, which ROS 1 lacked. This allows developers to build robots that meet cybersecurity
                requirements – important for any commercial deployment, especially in healthcare or defense.</p>
            <p><b>Cross-Platform and Embedded Support:</b> ROS 1 was tied closely to Linux, but ROS 2 supports multiple
                platforms (Linux, Windows, macOS, and real-time OSs). Microsoft’s contribution ensured ROS 2 works on
                Windows 10/11, enabling robots to run on Windows-based industrial PCs. There’s also micro-ROS for
                microcontrollers, extending ROS 2 into embedded devices (sensors, MCUs) that couldn’t run the heavy ROS
                1. This broad platform support makes ROS 2 viable in diverse industrial environments.</p>
            <p><b>Better Software Architecture:</b> ROS 2 implements features like managed/lifecycle nodes (nodes have
                explicit states for startup/shutdown, making system bring-up more reliable), component composition
                (nodes can be launched in the same process to save resources), and improved middleware interfaces.
                Common libraries were rewritten and improved: e.g., MoveIt2 (motion planning) now has better real-time
                performance and new capabilities, and the Navigation2 stack (Nav2) offers a more flexible,
                behavior-tree-based architecture for robot navigation. These upgrades mean ROS 2 is not just a drop-in
                replacement; it’s a stronger framework for building complex, reliable robot behaviors.</p>
            <p><b>Certification and Quality:</b> ROS 2’s core is developed with more rigorous processes (the ROS 2
                Technical Steering Committee includes experts from industry and academia focusing on quality). A subset
                of ROS 2 has even been safety-certified to automotive standards (ISO 26262 ASIL-D) by Apex.AI for use in
                autonomous driving. This was virtually impossible with ROS 1. As Apex’s CTO noted, ROS 2 is “the most
                field-proven robotics framework” and now with real-time and certification in place, there is no serious
                barrier to using it in production. In short, ROS 2 is enterprise-ready in a way ROS 1 never was.</p>

            <p>Early ROS2 adopters in material handling demonstrate its production viability:</p>
            <p><b>Mobile Manipulation:</b> Southwest Research Institute deployed ROS2-based scan-n-plan systems
                combining autonomous mobile platforms with robotic arms for inventory management. The Tesseract motion
                planning framework’s migration to pure CMake/ROS2 enabled deterministic performance in 6-DOF
                manipulation tasks.</p>
            <p><b>Fleet Coordination:</b> ARM Institute Project 18-01 achieved multi-robot interoperability across
                heterogeneous platforms (Yaskawa, KEBA) using ROS2’s native DDS orchestration. This eliminated
                middleware translation layers present in ROS1 implementations, reducing latency by 40%.</p>
            <p><b>Process Automation:</b> Robotic coating removal systems utilizing ROS2 demonstrated 99.8%
                communication reliability in EMI-intensive environments through QoS-managed DDS configurations.</p>
            <p><b>Emerging Applications Beyond Traditional Manufacturing</b></p>
            <p>ROS2’s flexibility enables novel industrial applications:</p>
            <p><b>Aerospace:</b> NASA’s VIPER lunar rover employs ROS2 for autonomous navigation in low-bandwidth,
                high-latency lunar conditions. The framework’s support for intermittent connectivity via
                “store-and-forward” messaging patterns proves critical for extraterrestrial operations.</p>
            <p><b>Agriculture:</b> John Deere’s ROS2-based autonomous tractors leverage the framework’s real-time weed
                detection pipelines, processing 15 FPS from multi-spectral cameras on embedded Jetson platforms.</p>
            <p><b>Energy:</b> Schlumberger’s downhole inspection robots utilize ROS2’s security features for encrypted
                communication in offshore oil rigs, meeting NIST SP 800-82 compliance.</p>
